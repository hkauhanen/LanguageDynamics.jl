# LanguageDynamics

LanguageDynamics is a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package for exploring the **population dynamics of language** by means of agent-based simulations. It implements several common models of language acquisition, use and change (such as utterance selection and variational learning) in a variety of community structures ranging from fully mixing "pools" of speakers to spatial populations and multiplex networks. To facilitate extending the library with custom types and function, minimal restrictions are placed on what objects may interface with what other objects.

The [Getting started](@ref) section provides installation instructions and a simple usage example. The [Philosophy](@ref) page explains the design philosophy of LanguageDynamics in more detail. A number of further use cases are illustrated under [Examples](@ref). The Reference pages provide documentation for all available functions and objects, for [populations](Population reference), interactors and [Replicators](@ref) separately. A further reference pages documents auxiliary functions.
