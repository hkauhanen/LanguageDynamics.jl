# LanguageDynamics

LanguageDynamics.jl is a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package for exploring the **population dynamics of language** by means of agent-based simulations. It implements several common models of language acquisition, use and change (such as utterance selection and variational learning) in a variety of community structures ranging from fully mixing "pools" of speakers to spatial populations and multiplex networks. To facilitate extending the library with custom types and functions, minimal restrictions are placed on what objects may interface with what other objects.

The [Getting started](@ref) section provides installation instructions and a simple usage example. The [Philosophy](@ref) page explains the design philosophy of LanguageDynamics.jl in more detail. A number of further use cases are illustrated under [Examples](@ref). The Reference pages provide documentation for all available functions and objects.

!!! warning
    LanguageDynamics.jl is in the very early stages of its development. Expect stuff to break and change over time. Most design principles of the package have yet to be set in stone, and **versions in the 0.1.x series in particular must not be considered stable in any way**.

LanguageDynamics.jl is free and open-source software, licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
